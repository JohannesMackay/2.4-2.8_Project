  <h2>This is an extract from the American Assocation for the advancement of science (AAAS) article - <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/artificial-intelligence-evolving-all-itself# "target="_blank">Artificial intelligence is evolving all by itself</a></h2>

  Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving—literally. Researchers have created software that borrows concepts from Darwinian evolution,
  including “survival of the fittest,” to build AI programs that improve generation after generation without human input. The program
  replicated decades of AI research in a matter of days, and its designers think that one day, it could discover new approaches to AI.
  Building an AI algorithm takes time. Neural  networks loosely mimic the structure of the brain and learn from training data by altering the strength of connections
  between artificial neurons. Smaller subcircuits of neurons carry out specific tasks—for instance, spotting road signs—and researchers
  can spend months working out how to connect them so they work together seamlessly. These programs still rely on stitching together ready-made circuits designed by humans.
  That means the output is still limited by engineers’ imaginations and their existing biases. A program called AutoML-Zero
  has been made that can develop AI programs with effectively zero human input, using only basic mathematical concepts a
  high school student would know.

    The program starts by creating a population of 100 candidate algorithms by randomly combining mathematical operations. It then tests them
    on a simple task, such as an image recognition problem where it has to decide whether a picture shows a cat or a truck.
    Copies of the top performers are “mutated” by randomly replacing, editing, or deleting some of its code to create slight
    variations of the best algorithms. These “children” get added to the population, while older programs get culled.
    The system creates thousands of these populations at once so that the machine can test tens of thousands of algorithms in seconds.
    The program also uses tricks to speed up the search, like occasionally exchanging algorithms between populations to prevent any evolutionary
    dead ends, and automatically weeding out duplicate algorithms. Joaquin Vanschoren, a computer scientist at the Eindhoven University of Technology,
    thinks it will be a while before the approach can compete with the state-of-the-art. One thing that could improve the program, he says, is not asking
    it to start from scratch, but instead seeding it with some of the tricks and techniques humans have discovered. “We can prime the pump with
    learned machine learning concepts.” But Le also believes boosting the number of mathematical operations in the library and dedicating even more computing
    resources to the program could let it discover entirely new AI capabilities.
