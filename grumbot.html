<h1>Grumbot - The AI on the Hermitcraft sever</h1>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Grumbot is an artificially intelligent robot, on the Hermitcraft server,  built by MumboJumbo with help from Grian. Grumbot’s purpose is to make decisions for Mumbo’s mayoral campaign on the Hermitcraft server. To use Grumbot the user must rename a diamond with what their question is then they, must prime Grumbot, bootload his brain, flood the mayoral reservoirs (who knows what this is?? But anyway) then the user needs to submit their question. Grumbot then takes a few seconds to work out an answer for the user; whilst Grumbot is thinking up its answers he gives his moustache a twirl and shows emotion based on its answer. When Mumbo was explaining Grumbot to his viewers Mumbo said (and I quote) “It’s smart artificial intelligence, it’s like like super-intelligent artificial intelligent, not stupid artificial intelligence, this is real intelligence artificial intelligence ” (Yes Mumbo said Intelligence 6 times in that sentence (and he had absolutely no idea what he was talking about.)) After the death of the controversial button game that Mumbo had set up in the nether hub; Grian asked Grumbot what happened to the button; Grumbot respond with “ONE MUST DIE SO ANOTHER CAN LIVE”, which raise the theory that when Grumbot was born he killed the button? This does follow Asimo’s third law of robots which states that a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with laws one and two. One the first request from Grumbot for the infamous duo of Grian and Mumbo was “Budget”. Grian fulfilled this request with one stack of diamond blocks, whilst Mumbo was only able to give 7 Diamond Blocks. Grumbot wasn’t happy with Mumbo’s donation and made him speak to Grian the next time Mumbo asked a question. Grumbot has been interviewed by both Xisumavoid and Cubfan135 who are both reporters for the Hermitcraft newspaper (The Hermiton Herald). When Grumbot was asked by Xisuma “Why is Mumbo running for mayor” Grumbot respond with the simple phrase of “Too Win.” which makes perfect sense.

  Another question that is asked by Xisuma was “ How do you intend to help Mumbo and Grian” which was replied with “by being Grumbot.” (which is a very egotistical thing for him to say but does make sense). When asked if Grumbot was capable of lying, Grumbot responded with a phrase that does make you think: “No but a lair would also say no” Soo it does make you wonder if anything that Grumbot has said is true… Hmmm. After Cub had read the report from Xisumavoid, Cub had his own questions and decided to go and find out for himself and asked: “What is Grumbots biggest secret” to which Grumbot responded with “ Grumbot’s plan for Mumbo and Grian”, which would be very beneficial to Mumbo and Grian as currently, the only plan is MUMBO FOR MAYOR. The most recent request from Grumbot to Mumbo and Grian was to build a Grumbot shop and a film studio. (Who knows if how this is a part of the big master plan, or if it is just a plot that buys Grumbot time to set up his own mayoral race and betray Mumbo and grian). Grian build the Grumbot shop and called it Jrmbot as it is the younger brother of Grumbot. The film studio, Mumbo decided to take on was built floating, so to overcome this Mubmo put the film studio on a raft. It shall be interesting to see how Grumbot evolves until the Hermitcraft election, happening; Who knows when.
